## Graphic Objects Library
# GOLIB 95-97

This is a project that brings back to the years 1994-1997. It is the first big project I have ever made when Internet was not broadly available and the software were sold with magazines.

This is a library for creating MS-DOS application with graphical user interface.

It was inspired by the amazing Windows 95 that was just released and at that time I had the desire to create a graphical UI that imitated the one of Windows 95.

This project it's been for me the launch ramp in my learning path in computer science. I have learned so much doing GOLIB.

This project has been created on a PC 386SX 25Mhz with 4 MB of RAM and 40 MB hard drive gently made available by my dear friends **Berardino** and **Raffaele**. GOLIB has been written with [Borland Pascal 7.0](https://winworldpc.com/product/borland-pascal/7x) and [Turbo Assembler 2.0](https://winworldpc.com/product/turbo-assembler/20).

GOLIB has never been released, but now it's time to share for not forgetting and preserving this my personal milestone.
